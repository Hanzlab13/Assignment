Task 1: Scraping Data

You can use libraries like BeautifulSoup in Python to scrape data from classified websites like Pakwheels or OLX. Identify the website's structure, inspect elements to find relevant data, and use Python scripts to extract it.

Task 2: Creating a CSV file

After scraping, organize the data into a structured format and save it as a CSV file using Python's built-in CSV module or pandas library.

Task 3: Data Preprocessing

Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and converting data types if necessary. You can use libraries like pandas for this task.

Task 4: Data Visualization

Use Matplotlib or Seaborn in Python to create visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, or bar charts to explore trends or relationships in the data. Alternatively, you can use tools like Power BI for interactive visualizations.

Task 5: Writing a Report

For each graph or analysis, provide a brief description of what the visualization shows and any insights or conclusions drawn from it. Include factors like price distribution, trends over time, or correlations between variables.
