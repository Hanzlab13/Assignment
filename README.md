Scraping and Visualizing Used Car Data from Pakwheels

This Python script scrapes data from the Pakwheels website, specifically used car listings, and then visualizes the collected data using Matplotlib. It also creates a CSV file containing the scraped data for further analysis.

1-How it Works

(a) Scraping Data: The script sends a GET request to the Pakwheels website's used car listings page and extracts relevant information such as car name, price, and mileage using BeautifulSoup.

(b) Creating CSV File: The scraped data is then stored in a CSV file named cars_data.csv using the pandas library.

(c) Preprocessing Data: If needed, you can perform data preprocessing steps on the scraped data before visualization. However, in this example, no preprocessing is done.

(d) Visualizing Data: The script uses Matplotlib to create a scatter plot showing the relationship between car price and mileage.

2-Requirements
*Python 3.x
*requests
*beautifulsoup4
*pandas
*matplotlib

3-How to Use
.clone the repository or download the script scrape_and_visualize_cars.py.

.Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib

.Run the script:
python scrape_and_visualize_cars.py

4-After execution, the script will generate a CSV file named 'cars_data.csv' and display a scatter plot showing the relationship between car price and mileage.
